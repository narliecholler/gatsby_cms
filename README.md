### Gatsby Headless CMS (WordPress)

-- currenntly working off DEV branch -- 

# What is this repo?

This project is about creating a website for a family member, someone who plays a musical instrument and has a duet called 'The Boticelli Duet.' I decided to offer my help
and create a website for her, seeing it as a good opportunity to mess around with Gatsby and headless CMS.

# What is the tech stack and other tech used?

1. Gatsby,
2. Wordpress as the backend (combined with Advanced Custom Fields),
3. Netlify to host Frontend, using this repo and triggering builds from master,
4. Digital Ocean Droplet to host the WordPress instance.
